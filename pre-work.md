An introductory tutorial to R has been prepared, you can access it here: http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/R_tutorial  
 
If you have previous R experience, you should still review the tutorial material. The workshop will assume that you are quite comfortable at this introductory level. 
 
A very useful R cheatsheet can be found here: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf
